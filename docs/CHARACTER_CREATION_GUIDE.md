## Creating a New Character Profile

### Method 1: Using the Character Creation Function

```javascript
// Example of creating a new character
const newCharacter = addCharacter({
    name: "Character Name",
    series: "Series Name",
    image: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    description: "Character description...",
    age: "20",
    role: "Main Character",
    personality: "Friendly & Determined",
    analysis: "Detailed character analysis...",
    reasons: "Reason 1\nReason 2\nReason 3",
    galleryImages: [
        "https://example.com/image1.jpg",
        "https://example.com/image2.jpg"
    ]
});
```

### Method 2: Manual HTML Creation

When creating a character page manually, ensure it includes:

1. **Required Scripts**:
```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
<script src="comment-system.js"></script>
<script src="security-patch.js"></script>
```

2. **Rating Section**:
```html
<div class="rating-section">
    <h2>Rating</h2>
    <div id="rating-{characterId}" class="rating-container">
        <div class="rating-display">
            <span class="stars">★★★★☆</span>
            <span class="rating-text">0.0/5 (0 votes)</span>
        </div>
        <div class="rating-buttons">
            <button onclick="rateCharacter('{characterId}', 1)" class="star-btn">1★</button>
            <button onclick="rateCharacter('{characterId}', 2)" class="star-btn">2★</button>
            <button onclick="rateCharacter('{characterId}', 3)" class="star-btn">3★</button>
            <button onclick="rateCharacter('{characterId}', 4)" class="star-btn">4★</button>
            <button onclick="rateCharacter('{characterId}', 5)" class="star-btn">5★</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

3. **Comment Section** (Automatically Added):
- The comment system automatically detects new character pages
- Comments section is added at the bottom of the page
- Width is automatically set to 70% of screen
- All security features are automatically applied

## Character Data Structure

### Required Fields:

{
    id: "unique-character-id",
    name: "Character Name",
    series: "Series Name",
    image: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    description: "Character description...",

{
    age: "20",
    role: "Main Character",

    analysis: "Detailed character analysis...",

    galleryImages: ["url1", "url2", "url3"],
    rating: 0,
    ratingCount: 0,
    comments: []
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation:
- **Name**: 2-50 characters, alphanumeric + basic punctuation
- **Comments**: 10-1000 characters, no HTML
- **Ratings**: 1-5 stars only
- **Images**: Must be valid URLs

### Rate Limiting:
- **Comments**: 3 per minute per user
- **Ratings**: 1 per character per user (stored in localStorage)
- **General**: 30 requests per minute per user

### Data Protection:
- No personal information collected
- IP addresses are hashed for rate limiting
- All user inputs are sanitized
- XSS protection on all outputs

## Testing New Characters

### 1. Create the Character:
```javascript
// Test character creation
const testCharacter = addCharacter({
    name: "Test Character",
    series: "Test Series",
    image: "https://via.placeholder.com/300x400",
    description: "This is a test character for testing purposes."
});
```

### 2. Test Rating System:
- Click different star ratings
- Verify average updates
- Check vote count increases

### 3. Test Comment System:
- Try posting comments with different names
- Test rate limiting (try posting 5 comments quickly)
- Verify comments appear immediately
- Test input validation (try HTML tags, very long text)

### 4. Test Security:
- Try XSS attacks in comments
- Try SQL injection in forms
- Verify rate limiting works
- Check CSRF protection

## Troubleshooting

### Comments Not Appearing:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify comment-system.js is loaded
3. Check if character ID is correct
4. Verify localStorage is working

### Rating System Not Working:
1. Check if script.js is loaded
2. Verify character ID in rating buttons
3. Check localStorage for rating data
4. Verify rating functions are defined

### Security Issues:
1. Check if security-patch.js is loaded
2. Verify CSP headers are set
3. Check console for security warnings
4. Test with security testing tools

## Best Practices

### For Character Creation:
1. **Use descriptive names** and series names
2. **Provide high-quality images** (300x400 minimum)
3. **Write detailed descriptions** and analysis
4. **Include multiple gallery images**
5. **Test all features** before publishing

### For Security:
1. **Always validate inputs** before processing
2. **Sanitize all user data** before storage
3. **Use HTTPS** for all external resources
4. **Monitor for suspicious activity**
5. **Keep security patches updated**

### For User Experience:
1. **Make comments easily readable** (70% width)
2. **Provide clear rating feedback**
3. **Show loading states** for async operations
4. **Handle errors gracefully**
5. **Make forms user-friendly**
