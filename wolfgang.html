                    Wolfgang Goldenleonard is the fourth prince and current King of Goldenleonard in the manhwa "King's Maker" and its sequel "King's Maker: Triple Crown". Born on July 26th, he is the only son of the late Lady Christine Luccia and the previous King of Goldenleonard. After surviving a devastating fire that destroyed his mother's manor, Wolfgang lived as a beggar on the streets, leading and caring for other orphaned children. He sacrificed himself to stop the palace from killing other boys named Wolfgang, which led to his return to the royal palace.
