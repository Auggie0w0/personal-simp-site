            <h2>Character Analysis</h2>
            <p>Dazai's character is a fascinating study in contrasts - his outwardly cheerful and flirtatious personality masks deep psychological trauma and suicidal ideation. His past as a Port Mafia executive adds layers of complexity to his character, and his relationship with Chuuya Nakahara reveals both his manipulative nature and his capacity for genuine connection. His ability "No Longer Human" is both a metaphor for his own feelings of alienation and a literal power that makes him unique in the world of ability users.</p>
