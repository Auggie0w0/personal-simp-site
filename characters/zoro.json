    "description": "Roronoa Zoro is a skilled swordsman and the first member to join Luffy's crew in the live action adaptation of One Piece. Portrayed by Mackenyu, Zoro is a disciplined warrior with dreams of becoming the world's greatest swordsman. His distinctive green hair and three-sword fighting style make him instantly recognizable.",

    "birthday": "November 11",
    "role": "First Mate/Swordsman",
    "personality": "Stoic & Determined",
    "analysis": "Mackenyu's portrayal of Roronoa Zoro brings the iconic character to life with impressive sword skills and physical presence. His performance captures Zoro's unwavering loyalty to his captain and crew, as well as his relentless pursuit of strength. The live action adaptation maintains Zoro's core traits: his terrible sense of direction, his dedication to swordsmanship, and his unbreakable resolve.",
