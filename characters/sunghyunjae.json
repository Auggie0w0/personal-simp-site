    "description": "Sung Hyunjae is the leader of Seseong Guild and one of the strongest Korean S-rank Hunters in 'The S-Ranks That I Raised'. Known for his unpredictable and chaotic nature, he is an extremely talented and skilled man with a penchant for pursuing interesting or fun things, and holds a particular interest in the protagonist Han Yoojin.",
    "age": "38",
    "birthday": "August 30",
    "role": "Guild Leader/S-Rank Hunter",
    "personality": "Chaotic & Unpredictable",
    "analysis": "Though perceived by the general public as a gentlemanly, distinguished, and well-mannered man, Sung Hyunjae has a reputation for being chaotic and unpredictable amongst Hunters, sometimes described as a madman. He is prone to doing as he wishes regardless of whether it inconveniences or outright endangers other people, and chases after things that interest him with an obsessive and almost-predatory focus. His actions are largely calculated despite his apparent impulsiveness, and he is not often caught off-guard. His unpredictability stems from the overwhelming boredom he feels, having lived through numerous reincarnations orchestrated by the transcendent Crescent Moon, who gave him the name 'Little Moon' and is attempting to nurture him into a transcendent himself.",
